## To build this website, I turned towards GatsbyJS.

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a static site generator based on React. 

I had heard a lot about GatsbyJS and NextJS being the future of web development. After previously using Wordpress to build my website, I was definitely interested in an alternative.

Rather than build this site from scratch, I decided to start with a template. This way, I could pick apart all the code and play around it. I was already familiar with React and I wanted to see how the Gatsby framework incorporated all the components. 

After cloning a few different projects from the Gatsby showcase to pick apart, I found [Yellowcake](https://github.com/thriveweb/yellowcake). I chose this as I was able to see all the components and how they worked with each other. A surprising amount of projects were importing entire pages and components. If I couldn't see the files themselves, then it really defeated the purpose.

Gatsby is incredibly easy to develop with. I'm very happy I found it and plan on using it for future web projects. Rebuilding WildHeart's website with it is near the top of the list.
