My dive into JavaScript! This app uses JS to create HTML elements in the DOM. The elements are created dynamically, using API endpoints provided by the WildWish Ruby on Rails app.

The page displays animal info as cards, which also include a "wish" from the animal's list. The user can click a button on each card to donate a specific amount. The cards also display a progress bar for the wish, which fills with each donation.

This web app uses GET and POST requests to create donations, which are saved by the server side application.
