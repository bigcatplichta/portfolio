# A CLI app to practice OOP

This application was the first 'Hello World' app I created without a tutorial. Showcasing my knowledge of object oriented programming paradigms, the app uses Animal, Donor, and Toy classes that interact with eachother. It also keeps track of users with the name attribute of a Donor instance, setting that instance of Donor as the user and allows different users to be created and "logged in".

## Creating the Toys and Animals

When running 'toy-browser.rb', `toy_list` is defined as an array of hashes. This array is then passed to the `create_from_collection` method of the Toy class, which iterates of the array and creates a Toy instance with each hash. 

```
class Toy
    def initialize(toy_hash)
        toy_hash.each {|key, value| self.send("#{key}=", value)}
        @status = "Waiting to be donated"
        # @attributes is hash, info is used to instantiate new identical object when status is changed to 'donated'
        @attributes = {name: self.name, price: self.price, description: self.description}
        @@all << self
    end

    def self.create_from_collection(collection)
        collection.each do |toy_hash| 
            Toy.new(toy_hash)
        end
    end

end
```

Once these toys are created, the animals are created in a similar fashion with the `Animal.create_from_url(url)` class method. A separate `AnimalScraper` class is used to handle getting the animal info with its `scrape_animal_index` and `scrape_animal_info` instance methods. I'll go over scraping in another section.

## Creating the user

Before interacting with the app, we first need to create or select a user. This is done with a simple name attribute. The input is passed to the class method `Donor.find_or_create_by_name(name)`, which checks an array of all the users and either returns the user with a matching name, or creates a new one.

```
    def self.find_or_create_by_name(name)
        # On CLI instantiation, donor is created or selected if donor already exists
        if Donor.all.find {|donor| donor.name == name}
        user = Donor.all.find {|donor| donor.name == name}
        else
           user = Donor.new(name)
        end 
        user 
    end
```


## Using the app

After these collections are created, the application truly starts by creating a new instance of ToyBrowser and using the `call` method on it, which prints a list of animals and a menu.

```
# inside 'class ToyBrowser::CLI'

    def call
        2.times {puts} # gives some whitespace for spacing 
        puts "Choose which animal you want to buy a toy for:"
        sleep 1 # wait one second before printing list of animals
        puts
        list_animals 
        menu
    end 

    def list_animals
        Animal.list_all
    end

    def menu
        # print statements and logic to handle CLI menu
    end

```

Above in `list_animals`, `Animal.list_all` is called. This class method iterates over an array of all the animals (created by pushing each instance into the array when initialized), then prints the name of each one next to an index number.

The `menu` method uses a 'while' loop to keep some if/else conditionals repeating, which all check for certain input from the terminal.

```
    def menu
        # Display list of animals. User enters number to select animal or can list toys already donated by user
        # Selecting animal displays that individual animal's information and prompts for donation
        input = nil
        puts
        puts "Enter the number next to an animal to see more info:"
        puts "Enter 'donations' to see toys you have already donated."
        while input != "exit"
            input = gets.strip
            if input.to_i <= Animal.all.count && input.to_i > 0  
                current_animal = Animal.all[input.to_i-1]
                current_animal.display_info
                puts
                self.display_animal_profile_menu(current_animal)
                input = "" 
                while input.downcase != "exit"
                    input = gets.strip.downcase

                    # several line of if/else to check for input like "habitat" or "diet"
                    
                end
            elsif input.downcase == "donations"
                puts
                Donor.list_donations(@user)
                puts
            elsif input.downcase == "exit"
                thank_you 
            else 
                puts "Please enter the number next to an animal:"
            end 
        end
    end 
```

Above, `input` is initially set to nil. Then we loop inside `while input != "exit"`. Inside of this loop, if/else statements are used to check the input. If a number is entered, that animal with the corresponding index (minus 1 to account for the array index) and the animal information is shown. Additional if/else statements are inside a while loop after a number is entered, these check for input like "habitat" or "diet" and print out the appropriate info. The user can also enter "donations" to see a list of their previous donations.

## Donating toys

If a user inputs "donate", 'current_animal' is passed as an argument to 'list_toys'. This method prints out a list of all toys and prompts the user to select one.

```
    def list_toys(current_animal)
        2.times {puts}
        puts "Please pick a toy to send to #{current_animal.name}:"
        # List option of toys to select from. Selecting a toy adds that object instance to animal's list of donated items.
        # User can choose to go back to animal list to donate again or exit application.
        Toy.list_all
        input = nil
        while input != "exit"
            input = gets.strip
            if input.to_i <= Toy.all.count && input.to_i > 0
            current_toy = Toy.all[input.to_i-1]
            @user.donate(current_animal, current_toy) #add method argument to add toy to animal's list of donated items
            elsif input == "list"
            call 
            elsif input == "exit"
            thank_you 
            else
            puts "Please select the number next to a toy."
            end
        end
    end
```

When a number is entered, this input is used to select the toy from the array returned by 'Toy.all' with the corresponding index. 'current_toy' and 'current_animal' are then passed as arguments to '@user.donate'. '@user' is an instance variable of ToyBrowser which holds the instance of Donor, previously created when we entered a name.

This method takes the toy and animal as arguments, then sets the 'donated_to' and 'donated_by' attributes of the toy.

```
    def donate(animal, toy)
        # set toy.donated to/by, add toy to list of donated items
        # setting toy status to 'donated' removes that toy from the list of available toys
        # toy object instantiates new identical item to keep toy list populated
        toy.donated_to = animal
        toy.donated_by = self 
        toy.send("status=", "donated")
        puts
        puts "Thanks, #{self.name}! We're sending a #{toy.name} on your behalf, #{animal.name} will be very happy!"
        puts "Enrichment is an important part of an animal's life. It keeps them mentally engaged and healthy."
        puts
        donate_again?
    end
```

The 'Donor' class also includes methods such as 'list_donations' and 'donate_again', which provide further functionality of the app. 

```
    def self.list_donations(donor)
        # user can see list of items they have previously donated and to whom
        toys = Toy.donated_toys.select {|toy| toy.donated_by == donor }
        if toys.count == 0
            puts "You haven't donated anything yet!" 
        else 
            toys.each do |toy| 
                puts
                puts "#{toy.name} donated to #{toy.donated_to.name} the #{toy.donated_to.species}." 
            end
        end
        puts
        puts "Enter the number next to an animal to see more info:"
    end
```
Above, `list_donations` selects a toy from the list of 'donated_toys', which is a class variable of 'Toy' containing an array of all toys that have been donated. The toys are selected by checking the 'donated_by' attribute against the 'donor' that was passed as an argument. 

After donating, the app asks the user if they would like to return to the donation app. If the input is yes, a new instance of ToyBrowser is created and called, again prompting for a username. Because previous instances of Donors are still saved in the array of `Donor.all`, previously created donors can be used again.
