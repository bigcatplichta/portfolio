Built with Ruby on Rails.

A further iteration of the zoo animal app and still in progress, I am using this project to learn Ruby on Rails. This serves as the current backend for WildWish while I develop the front end with React.js.

The first draft of this app used the MVC design pattern to render dynamic HTML files. I have since reformatted the program API only, rendering JSON on the same RESTful routes.

The application utilizes OAuth for authentication. The database uses PostgreSQL.
