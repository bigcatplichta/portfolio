Written in Ruby, this was the first program I built.

The app uses object oriented programming to initialize a user when ran. The user can then browse profiles of animals and choose a toy on that animal's list to donate. 

Each donation to an animal is saved and associated to that username. Multiple users can be created. A list of users and what toys they donated can be viewed on each animal's profile page.

The animal data was scraped from a zoo's website, including name and birthday, bio, and species info.

I plan on building a web app with a simulated terminal to demo this. Please contact me if you have suggestions on implementing that!
