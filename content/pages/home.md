#### *My name is Matt, and I'm here to help.*

I am a developer driven to create products that make the world a better place.

As a founder, my entreprenurial spirit allows me to see the bigger picture of what I am working on, facilitating work that expands the product as a whole and turns ideas into reality.

I love the creativity behind finding solutions and thrive on learning new ways to tackle a problem. By integrating new methods and knowledge, I create innovative programs to provide real change to the world around me. 

I produce results, seen in my work with the [WildHeart Foundation](https://www.thewildheartfoundation.org), my passion project and the vehicle for my own development.

After building the organization's [homepage](https://mattplichtawild.com/posts/wild-heart-foundation/) with WordPress, I turned my attention towards software development. 

I love exploring and learning new things. I can pick up whatever tech you use, and I know I can help you go far with whatever you have going on.
