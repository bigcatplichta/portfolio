# Passion Drives Everything

My name is Matt, and I'm here to help.

I am a developer driven to create products that make the world a better place.

As a founder, my entreprenurial spirit allows me to see the bigger picture of what I am working on, facilitating work that expands the product as a whole and turns ideas into reality.

I love the creativity behind finding solutions and thrive on learning new ways to tackle a problem. By integrating new methods and knowledge, I create innovative programs to provide real change to the world around me. This can be seen in my work with the [WildHeart Foundation](https://www.thewildheartfoundation.org), my passion project and the vehicle for my own development.
